## Overview
This course introduces the art and practice of data analysis. It focuses on the preparation of data (data wrangling or munging), professional presentation of data and analysis, and the process of producing scalable, replicable work (statistical and literate programming). More than just learning the requisite code, I emphasize the professional outputs associated with a career in data analysis. This semester is a chance to get your hands dirty in the world of analysis and explore the new and challenging puzzles you face every day in this profession.


## Learning outcomes and objectives
Students who complete this course will be proficient junior analysts. They will be able to:
- build, clean, and manipulate quantitative data
- generate professional data visualizations
- present data-driven research to a professional audience
- write clear, efficient, reproducible code in the R programming language


## Expectations and workload
This is an advanced graduate course. The material is challenging, and the workload is intense. However, my expectations for the course and of your performance are appropriate to your standing as professionals and aspiring professionals in a top graduate program. 

> Success in this course will require 10-15 hours of work outside of class each week. Please do not enroll in this course if you cannot commit to these hours.


## Course material and software
I will post handouts, data, R scripts, and links to reading materials on our course github site. While there is no textbook to purchase, I will draw regularly on the following:
- Jenny Bryan's [Stat 545 collection](https://stat545.com/)
- Hadley Wickham et al.'s [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)  
- Claus Wilke's foundational text on visualization, [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)
- Winston Chang's [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)
- A basic introduction to R, my own [Survival Guide](https://austin-hart-pols.github.io/SurvivalGuide/)

You need regular and reliable access to R and RStudio IDE, and I urge you to bring your laptop to class. These programs work across platforms and are available for free. You will also need to connect RStudio with Github, a cloud-based `Git` repository for code sharing and collaboration (i.e., version control). You can find installation instructions in the Getting Started repository. 

Becoming proficient with these programs is a challenging, though necessary, part of this course. When you run into trouble (i) Review course materials, (ii) search online (seriously, Google knows the answer), (iii) ask your classmates, and (iv) ASK ME.


## Assignments and grading
Grades for the course will be assigned based on performance in the following areas:
- **Problem sets and Deliverables (80%)** 
Hands-on experience is the only way to build proficiency. So you will complete nine, equally-weighted exercises that ask you to put into practice what we cover in class. Problem sets (6) feature a series of discrete questions of varying degree of difficulty. I automatically drop the lowest problem set score when calculating final grades. Deliverables (3) include a recorded slide presentation, a research poster, and a codebook. I will distribute assignments two weeks in advance of the due date. Budget 10-15 hours to complete each exercise. I encourage you to consult with classmates, but your code and your written answers must be yours and yours alone. If someone else wrote or executed your code, it is not individual work. If you sent your code or scripts to someone else, you did not participate earnestly in the process of individual work. You may not consult with anyone not currently enrolled in or teaching this course. 
- **Analyst Portfolio (10%)** 
At the end of the semester, you will create a portfolio that includes an edited collection of your best work from the course and an updated resume tailored to a position in data analytics. You will post the portfolio to your GitHub page. 
- **Participation and professionalism (10%)**  
Professionalism is a critical part of success in the data analytics profession. So it will be an integral part of our training in this course. Aside from what one can do on a laptop, a good analyst is someone who engage with peers constructively and respectfully, who asks questions when expectations are unclear, and who creates inclusive environments for co-workers and clients. I will evaluate participation and professionalism throughout the semester in terms of your engagement with peers, with myself, and with the material during class-related activities. Do you come to class prepared? Do you ask and answer questions? Are you contributing to a constructive and inclusive environment?

Please take note of the assignment due dates and plan accordingly. I will not accept late work outside of truly unusual and unavoidable circumstances.

## Making the most of our time
I strongly encourage you to drop in during office hours or set up meetings on a semi-regular basis. I love working with students in this course, and I will do my best to help you think through challenges both big and small. I'm happy to discuss problem sets, the field of data analytics, your intellectual and professional goals, and whatever else is on your mind. I regularly work with students (current and former) to write letters of recommendation, organize independent study, supervise theses, hire TA/RAs,  etc. The sooner you come in to consult, the better.

## Academic Integrity, Group Work, and AI
Assignments in this course are individual exercises. The written work you submit must be substantially your own work. You are welcome to make use of appropriate research tools and materials to help learn how to answer a question or otherwise fulfill the assignment. Two in particular require special attention:

- *Collaborating with classmates:* I encourage you to study with your classmates and to talk through challenges and questions in written work. You may not co-write, edit, exchange, or otherwise share your answers or code. Posting your answers in a group chat or copying code posted by a classmate, for example, constitutes a violation of the Academic Integrity Code.
- *Using generative AI (ChatGPT, Bard, etc):* Use of AI is strongly discouraged. These tools may be able to answer some/all of questions on our assignments, and they can be incredibly useful for folks with strong foundational skills. For those just starting out, however, I believe that reliance on this technology inhibits the development of those core skills. If you choose to use AI tools in this course, you must submit an appendix with your work including verbatim text of your prompt and the output produced by the tool. 

In each case, you must start and finish your written work independently. Regardless of what resources you rely on in your work, you bear sole responsibility for the integrity of what you submit. 

Standards of academic conduct are set forth in the University's [Academic Integrity Code](https://www.american.edu/policies/students/academic-integrity-code.cfm). By registering for classes, you have acknowledged your awareness of the Academic Integrity Code, and you are obliged to become familiar with your rights and responsibilities as defined by the Code. Violations of the Academic Integrity Code will not be treated lightly, and disciplinary actions will be taken should such violations occur. Please see me if you have any questions about the academic violations described in the Code in general or as they relate to particular requirements for this course.


## Background knowledge
A background in introductory statistics—-equivalent to SIS-600-—is necessary for this course. So I will assume familiarity with descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations), hypothesis testing (through linear regression), and basic statistical computing (e.g., R or Stata).
